We've already explored [how to build an undirected tree from edges](/js/s/undirected-tree-from-edges) and [how to traverse it using DFS or BFS](/js/s/undirected-tree-dfs-bfs). Now, let's look at how to apply **bipartite coloring** to an undirected tree in JavaScript, ensuring that no two adjacent nodes share the same color.

## Bipartite coloring

Bipartite coloring is a way of coloring the nodes of a graph such that **no two adjacent nodes share the same color**. In the case of an undirected tree, this means that **each level of the tree can be colored with a different color**, ensuring that no two adjacent nodes (parent and child) share the same color.

Note that this is **always possible for trees**, as they are acyclic and connected graphs. The simplest way to achieve bipartite coloring is to use two colors, often represented as `0` and `1`.

Given the example presented in past articles, we can visualize the undirected tree as follows, with two colors applied:

This tree would correspond to the following edges array and `Map` representation:

```js
const edges = [ [0, 1], [0, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4] ];

const graphMap = new Map([
  [0, [1, 2]],
  [1, [0]],
  [2, [0, 3, 4]],
  [3, [2]],
  [4, [2]]
]);
```

## Implementation

To implement bipartite coloring, we can use a simple **DFS or BFS traversal algorithm**. We'll maintain a `colors` map to store the color of each node as we traverse the tree. I prefer using BFS for this task, as it allows us to color the nodes level by level.

@[Quick refresher](/js/s/undirected-tree-dfs-bfs#breadth-first-search-bfs)

```js {3-4,8,12-15}
const bfsBipartiteColoring = (graph, root) => {
  const queue = [root];
  const colors = new Map();
  colors.set(root, 0);

  while (queue.length) {
    const node = queue.shift();
    const currentColor = colors.get(node);

    const neighbors = graph.get(node) || [];
    for (const neighbor of neighbors)
      if (!colors.has(neighbor)) {
        colors.set(neighbor, 1 - currentColor);
        queue.push(neighbor);
      }
  }

  return colors;
};

bfsBipartiteColoring(graphMap, 0);
// Map(0 => 0, 1 => 1, 2 => 1, 3 => 0, 4 => 0)
```

As with BFS traversal, we start from the **root node** (in this case, `0`) and assign it a color (let's say `0`). We then **traverse its neighbors**, assigning them the opposite color (`1`). This process continues until all nodes are colored.

The final `colors` map will contain the **color of each node**, but we could have applied this to the original graph map with some tweaking or built a map with colors as the keys and nodes as the values.

## Conclusion

Building on top of the undirected tree structure and traversal algorithms, bipartite coloring is a straightforward application that ensures no two adjacent nodes share the same color. This technique is particularly useful in various graph-related problems, such as scheduling and resource allocation, where conflicts must be avoided. Hopefully, it will help you in your future projects and algorithms involving trees and graphs in JavaScript! ðŸ¤¿
