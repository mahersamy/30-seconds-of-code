Ever feel like your codebase is fighting you at every turn? **The tools you choose**, your programming language of choice, frameworks, and overall stack, shape how you build, refactor, and maintain software. Sometimes, the very flexibility that drew you in becomes the root of your biggest headaches. Let's dig into why your tech stack might be the silent culprit behind those endless refactoring sessions and mounting technical debt.

## Infinite flexibility, painful refactoring

**Flexible languages** like JavaScript and Python give you endless ways to solve a problem. That freedom feels empowering, but it comes with a catch. Every new feature, syntax, or method is a **potential footgun**. You can shoot yourself in the foot by designing APIs with **too many options**, **clever overloads**, or **many ways to do the same thing**. The result? Codebases that are **hard to reason about** and even harder to maintain.

When your codebase is a **patchwork of clever tricks** and alternative patterns, refactoring becomes a nightmare. You start with good intentions, but the **complexity grows**. Each refactor adds another layer of abstraction, another workaround, another set of edge cases. Instead of simplifying, you end up with a **tangled mess**. Debugging gets harder, productivity drops, and frustration rises.

## Opinionated stacks force better design

Languages like Go are (in)famously **opinionated**. They do not let you overload functions or invent alternative syntax for the same operation. You have to **pause and rethink your approach**. You are forced to design **explicit APIs** and **clear modules**. It feels **restrictive**, but it saves you from yourself. You spend less time refactoring and more time **building features that work**.

Ask yourself: do you need three ways to sort an array? Do you need methods with slightly different side effects? Is **infinite flexibility** helping, or is it just making your code harder to understand? Most of the time, a **simple, explicit API** is better. It is easier to **test**, easier to **debug**, and easier to **refactor** when you need to.

## Overengineering and technical debt

Before you add another method or another overload, **stop**. **Rethink your API**. Rethink your module boundaries. Would **splitting your code into smaller, focused modules** help? Would **making your API more explicit** reduce confusion? It is more painful now to rewrite something, but it is even more painful to **patch it over and watch the technical debt pile up**.

Trying to anticipate every possible future need leads to **overengineered solutions**. You add **hooks, options, and configuration** for things you might never use. As the codebase grows, **complexity mounts**, and soon you are crawling to a halt. **Technical debt** is not just a buzzword. It is the real cost of **poor design decisions** made in the name of flexibility.

## Keep it simple, force good design

Pause. **Redesign** your code. Make it simple. Split it into **modules** if needed. Force good design decisions. Make usage **explicit**. Favor **clear APIs** over clever ones. Every time you touch your code, make a small cleanup. You do not need refactor sprints. You just need to take care of your code, one change at a time.

A phrase I really like is "eat the frog". It means doing the hard thing first. Redesign, refactor, and **simplify before the debt piles up**. It is better to fix the problems early than to let poor technical decisions slow you down later. Your future self will thank you.

> Apparently, "eat the frog" is a time management technique, that means tackling your most challenging or dreaded task first thing in the morning. I had only heard of it on YouTube and thought it was just a metaphor. Still, the point stands: tackle the hard stuff early to avoid bigger headaches later.
